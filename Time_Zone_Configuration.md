# Configuring the Time Zone

Setting the printer to my local time zone.

`sudo timedatectl set-timezone America/Denver`

This was done to try to configure NTP auto updating but never fully figured that part out.  System is more limited than my desktop and found out there is already another service updating the time.  See config changes for that.
