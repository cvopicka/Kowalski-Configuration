# Kowalski-Configuration

WARNING This worked for ME and MY printer.  I have used Linux for many years and deal with various system administration tasks daily.  My comfort level is high.  Use at your own risk!!!  Know this may completely destroy your system.  NOT MY PROBLEM!

Configuration changes from the original Elegoo Neptune 4 Pro settings

BTW my printer is named Kowalski

- STEP 1 CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD
  - Technically I upgraded the system to use certificates for SSH authentication NOT PASSWORD.
- [Services](Services.md) to clean-up services
- [Time zone](Time_Zone_Configuration.md) to configure the proper machine time zone
